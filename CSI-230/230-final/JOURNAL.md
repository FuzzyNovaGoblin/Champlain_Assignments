# Journal/log stuff for CSI-230 final

I placed a lot of references to FuzzyNovaGoblin and FuzyTech in this project, such as the name FuzCalc this is because I just wanted it to seem more official and legit. I do own FuzyTech LLC so that is not a joke and FuzzyNovaGoblin is my Github username / the name I publish all my code as

I know there is some debate about the use of `using namespace std;` because of the potential naming colisions it can cause and actualy removes the whole point of the namespace. But the way I see it only the header files get inclued into other's code so I would say it is taboo to use it in a header but to use it is src files is okay  as long as it

I know using the different C++ file extentions doesnt make a difference so I like to use cpp for *normal stuff* but then use cc for anything that I compile to a .so

I relized I was using a deprecated version of gtk so I had to start over at some point
