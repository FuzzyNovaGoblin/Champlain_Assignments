server and client will default to connecting to 127.0.0.1:54321
if you want to change the ip pass it as an argument when launching the server and client
if you want to change the port you must pass an ip first and pass the port as the second argument

once you launch the server you don't have to touch it again
when you launch the client you must give it a display name before you are connected
there is no authentication of this name, its the wild west, so you can take whatever name you want even if it was alredy taken
when you are in the client your curser might display in a wierd spot but if you start typing it shold show where it actualy is
on some devices you can not delete so you will have to move your curser over existing letter and just type space
to send a message to everyone just type your message and hit enter
to send a message to just one person say @[name] with any name aof a user that is signed in
to log out type !exit


There should also be a version of this running at fuzytech.com
so running client.py fuzytech.com will connect you to a public version of this
hopefuly this is actualy running if you decide to test this and yes fuzy is spelled with 1 'z'
